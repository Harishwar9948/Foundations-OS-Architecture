# Operating System Architecture – Security Foundations

This project contains my learning notes and study materials on **Windows** and **Linux** operating system architectures.

Understanding the internal structure of operating systems is crucial for cybersecurity analysts, penetration testers, and digital forensics experts. These documents break down:

## Reports Included

- **Windows Configuration and Monitoring**
- **Windows Memory Architecture and Registry Analysis**
- **Windows OS Boot, Startup, and Process Management**
- **Linux Basics and OS Internals**

##  Why This Matters

Before using tools like Metasploit or analyzing traffic with Wireshark, it’s essential to understand how operating systems work under the hood.

These notes serve as a foundation for:
- Privilege escalation
- Malware behavior analysis
- Process and memory exploitation
- Detection evasion techniques
